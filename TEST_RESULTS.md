# MCP Server Test Results

## Summary

The MCP server is working correctly and now supports running without cache. API keys should be configured in the MCP client, not in the server's `.env` file.

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Cache initialization issue**: The MCP server was trying to initialize providers before the cache was ready. This has been fixed by moving provider initialization to the `start()` method.

2. **Missing tslib dependency**: The AWS SDK required tslib which was missing. This has been installed.

3. **Cache is now optional**: The server now works without cache configuration. If cache initialization fails or is not configured, the server will continue running without caching.

## Current Status

- ✅ MCP server starts successfully
- ✅ All 9 tools are registered and available
- ✅ Cache is now optional (server works without cache)
- ✅ All tests pass (77 tests)
- ✅ Environment variables should be set in MCP client

## MCP Client Configuration

When using this MCP server with a client (like Claude Desktop), configure the environment variables in the client's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cost-management": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/cost-management-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-...",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "...",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "...",
        "GCP_BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID": "...",
        "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "path/to/service-account.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Test Scripts
