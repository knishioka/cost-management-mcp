# Cache is Now Optional

## Summary

The MCP server now works without any cache configuration. This makes it easier to get started and test the server without setting up Redis or worrying about cache configuration.

## How it Works

1. **No Cache Mode**: When cache environment variables are not set, the server uses a `NoOpCacheManager` that doesn't actually cache anything
2. **Graceful Degradation**: All providers handle cache errors gracefully and continue operating
3. **Optional Configuration**: Cache-related environment variables are now optional in `.env`

## Running Without Cache

Simply start the server without setting cache environment variables:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

You'll see in the logs:

```
{"level":"info","message":"Running without cache"}
```

## Running With Cache

To enable caching, set the cache environment variables:

```bash
CACHE_TYPE=memory
CACHE_TTL=3600
```

You'll see in the logs:

```
{"level":"info","message":"Cache initialized","data":{"type":"memory","ttl":3600}}
```

## Benefits

1. **Easier Setup**: No need to configure cache for testing or development
2. **Flexibility**: Can run in environments where caching isn't needed
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If cache initialization fails, server continues working
4. **Performance Trade-off**: You can choose between performance (with cache) and simplicity (without cache)

## Environment Variables

As mentioned in the original question, environment variables should be set in the MCP client configuration, not in the server's `.env` file. The `.env` file is mainly for local testing.
